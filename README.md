Udemy class: [Modern JavaScript From the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)

This repo contains copies of the course projects. I don't keep temporary files that are used to explore JavaScript through the console.

## Projects

The class consists of eight projects.

### Task List (`tasklist`)

This project focuses on vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation. We start with a simple HTML file that scaffolds a bare bones task list application. Vanilla JavaScript is used to provide the full functionality of the app via DOM maipulation.
