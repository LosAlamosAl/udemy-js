Udemy class: [Modern JavaScript From the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)

This repo contains copies of the course projects. I don't keep temporary files that are used to explore JavaScript through the console.

## Projects

The class consists of eight projects.

### Task List (`tasklist`)

This project focuses on vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation. We start with a simple HTML file that scaffolds a bare bones task list application. Vanilla JavaScript is used to provide the full functionality of the app via DOM maipulation.

These are some links to [useful](https://gist.github.com/thegitfather/9c9f1a927cd57df14a59c268f118ce86) links for information on [Vanilla JavaScript](https://vanillajstoolkit.com).

### Loan Calculator

I didn't save this project as I was unable to write it from scratch without watching the solution videos. I like to try to write the demo myself, before watching the instructior's solution. Sometimes there is not enough introductory information to fully describe how the project's application should operate. That was the case here.

### Number Guesser (`number-guesser`)

I was able to write theis project from scratch, whithout watching the solution
videos. Again, the HTML source is provided by the instructor. The JavaScript
code provides the full functionality of the application.

### Book List (`booklist`)

I watched the video and duplicated the look and feel for the app. I only used
OO JavaScript for the book itself (i.e. title, author, etc.). The instructor
created an OO approach to the UI as well. I didn't do this initially and can't
see the advantage to backfilling it.
